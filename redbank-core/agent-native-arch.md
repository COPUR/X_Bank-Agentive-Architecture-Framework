# Technical Requirements Document: Agent-Native Architecture

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the architectural and security requirements for migrating from a traditional microservices architecture to a Multi-Agent System (Agent-Native Architecture). The system will support autonomous, stateful agents capable of complex reasoning, long-term memory, and dynamic orchestration.

## 2. Architectural Requirements
* **REQ-ARCH-01 (Domain Agents):** The architecture must transition from traditional microservices (bounded contexts) to autonomous Domain Agents capable of understanding goals and reasoning.
* **REQ-ARCH-02 (Orchestration):** The system must replace static Saga patterns and state machines with real-time, intent-driven Multi-Agent Workflows.
* **REQ-ARCH-03 (Agent Gateway):** An "Agent Gateway" must be implemented to manage the agent fleet and explicitly block prompt injection attacks, replacing standard API Gateways.
* **REQ-ARCH-04 (Memory Banks):** The system must support persistent Memory Banks that allow agents to recall past user actions and learn over time, replacing static database read/write models.

## 3. Runtime & Execution Environment
* **REQ-RUN-01 (Stateful Runtime):** The agent runtime must support stateful, long-running processes (e.g., pausing for days pending user verification). It should leverage a hybrid infrastructure utilizing Kubernetes, Temporal, and the Actor Model.
* **REQ-RUN-02 (Strict Sandboxing):** Autonomous agents executing code or making external API calls must be isolated in strict sandboxed environments (such as **WASM** or **gVisor**). Standard Docker environments are insufficient due to cyber risks.

## 4. Memory Management & Data Security
* **REQ-MEM-01 (Stored XSS Prevention):** To prevent malicious inputs from manipulating future agent decisions (Stored XSS for AI), the system must implement strict safeguards before writing to vector databases.
* **REQ-MEM-02 (Write Filters & Trust Scoring):** All data entering the Long-Term Memory (which may contain PII and financial data) must pass through strict write filters and trust scoring mechanisms to prevent context exfiltration.

## 5. Zero Trust & Incident Response (Kill Switch)
* **REQ-SEC-01 (Zero Trust):** Zero Trust principles must be rigorously applied at the agent level. Cryptographic agent identities (e.g., **SPIFFE ID**) must not be equated with implicit trust.
* **REQ-SEC-02 (Deterministic Kill Switch):** The system must feature a deterministic, hardware-level "Kill Switch" to respond to anomalies or authorization breaches instantly.
* **REQ-SEC-03 (Kill Switch Execution):** Upon detecting an anomaly, the system must autonomously execute the following incident response steps:
    * **Identity Revocation:** Immediately block access at the **Istio Mesh** level and revoke the agent's SPIFFE ID.
    * **Runtime Kill:** Scale the associated agent deployment down to zero and instantly sever its access to the **Kafka** event backbone.
    * **Memory Freeze:** Disable all write operations to the agent's memory and capture a snapshot of the current state for legal/forensic auditing.
